# 🎉 ExamyNex - Project Completion Summary

## ✅ What Has Been Completed

### 1. Backend Infrastructure ✨
- **Fixed API Endpoints**: Created `/auth/login` and `/auth/register` routes in addition to `/users` routes for frontend compatibility
- **Added Missing Endpoints**:
  - `GET /users/me` - Get current user information
  - `GET /exams/{id}` - Get single exam by ID
  - `GET /exams/{id}/questions` - Get questions for specific exam
  - Submissions endpoints already existed and are working
- **Enhanced CORS**: Added multiple frontend origins (localhost:5500, 8080, etc.)
- **WebSocket Support**: Live monitoring for admins at `/ws/admin`

### 2. Frontend Architecture 🎨
- **Created Centralized Config** (`config.js`):
  - Single source of truth for API URLs
  - Helper functions `getApiUrl()` and `getWsUrl()`
  - Easy to update for deployment
